# WestMonster_FPS_Base
Multiplayer FPS Base for WestMonster Games in the Godot Game Engine.

I created this with the intent to sell it, until I found a project, Nodot, that accomplishes this goal, but does it far better and is more flexible, so now I will be contributing to that project, instead.

This project has the following features:

- Quake-style movement
- Ballistic projectiles(They fly through the air rather than being hitscans, and their trajectory is influenced by gravity)
- Sprinting
- Configurable jumping, wherein you specify height and time, rather than velocity
- "Collision Material" System used by bullet impact decals, but can also be used to handle footstep sounds based on texture used
- Configurable guns(Full auto, Semi-auto, selectable fire-modes, adjustable accuracy and precision, barrel heatup influencing those variables, etc.)
- Aiming Down Sights
- Weapon Bob
- Ladders
- Clambering
- Stairs
- Crouching
- Doors(sliding, Source Engine-like physics-based doors were in the works, but couldn't get it working.)
- Buttons(which can activate doors and potentially other things)
- Dials(Which can control the open/close state of doors like in Half-Life)
- Swimable water
